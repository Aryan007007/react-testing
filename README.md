This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Day 1
1. Initiated the project with create-react-app and emptied the source folder and started building a webapp from scratch.
2. Installed antd library, and experimented with the different features of it.

## Day 2
1. Created a layout of the app using form and date picker for the input area.
2. Installed the redux and react-redux libraries.
3. Tried to implement the redux concept as per my capabilities, deploying the store and using states.
